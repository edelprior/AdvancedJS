#Problem (Solved using Ternary operators and for loops)

## Write A program in JS that prints the numbers from 1 - 100.

* For the multiples of 3 print.ln "Design" rather than the number.
* For the multiples of 5 print.ln "Tech" rather than the number.
* For both the multiples of 3 & 5, print.ln "DesignTech".
